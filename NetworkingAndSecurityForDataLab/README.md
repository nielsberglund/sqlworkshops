Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on SQL Server in both on-premise, in-cloud and hybrid solutions. In this one-day workshop, you'll gain a deep understanding on the latest SQL Server engine and how you can use it to solve real-world challenges. 

The modules in this workshop lead you through conceptual and hands-on topics ranging from the newest technical features in SQL Server to its implementation in all platforms it runs on. You'll learn not only specific  

You'll start by <TODO: Describe what the flow of the workshop will be>, with a focus on how to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions for your organization.

This README.MD file explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

### Abstract
Many organizations are faced with an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. You need a plan for how to decide if, when, and how you should upgrade your systems, when to extend them to the cloud, what to keep on and what can work in a hybrid fashion.

Members from the Azure SQL Product Group will lead you through the data estate options from Microsoft, from on-premises SQL Server (including some of the new features in SQL Server) to Relational Database options in Azure. You'll how to evaluate the benefits/costs of each technology option, and give you multiple tools that you can take home to inventory, evaluate, and migrate your current data platform environment to the best configuration.

In this day-long, hands-on workshop you’ll learn how to:

 - Articulate the key differentiators between SQL Server on-prem, in Azure VM, in Azure SQL DB, and hybrid
 - Explain the different service tiers within Azure SQL DB, and what to choose when
 - Understand how Azure SQL DB is secured and address security concerns
 - Learn what hybrid entails for Azure SQL DB and SQL Server in some common examples
 - Get hands on with some of the features in SQL Server and Azure SQL DB
 - Understand "other" Azure platform features 
 - Understand what services are available to migrate and modernize your entire SQL Server stack
 - Make informed decisions about how your business or customers should modernize their data estate
 
This course contains lecture and hands on lab work, and is particularly useful for Solution Architects, Data Architects, Application Architects, Technical Sellers, and Application Developers. BYOD and experience with SQL is considered a prerequisite.

The concepts and skills taught in this workshop form the starting points for:

    <TODO: Job Description and level of person who is the primary that should attend and the reason>.
    For instance: Solution Architects and Developers, to understand how to put together an end to end solution.
    <TODO: Job Description and level of person who is the secondary that should attend and the reason>.
    <TODO: Job Description and level of person who is the third-level of who might want to attend and the reason>.

Businesses require <TODO: Describe the reason the student's business or organization would be interested in the information. Be detailed about the solutions it addresses> 

Some industry examples of <TODO: Workshop Topic> are <TODO: Enter Sectors and use briefly>, to name just a few.

The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets.

This workshop expects that you understand <TODO: Enter a brief solution for what a student should know before taking the workshop>.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class:

These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to turn off any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.
