SQL Server 2019 is a modern data platform designed to tackle the challenges of today's data professional. SQL Server 2019 is not just an upgrade option from previous releases of SQL Server. 

The WideWorldImporters company has been evaluating upgrading several SQL Server 2008 instances along with some instances of SQL Server 2012, 2014, and even 2016. WideWorldImporters wants to know whether SQL Server 2019 will solve some of the challenges they face including:

- Improving query performance without having to make application changes
- Classifying key data columns and being able to audit access to these columns to meet the needs of GDPR compliance.
- Providing better database availability when applications use long-running transactions.
- Allowing the WideWorldImporters team to access data from sources like Oracle, Azure SQL Database, and Azure CosmosDB without having to develop expensive ETL jobs.
- The database team at WideWorldImporters has evaluated SQL Server on Linux but SQL Server 2017 didn't include Replication, a feature they need for their application. They would like to evaluate how SQL Server Replication on Linux works. They also want to understand more about container technology and how it can be used with SQL Server.
- WideWorldImporters is also evaluating Azure SQL so wants to know what features in SQL Server 2019 also work in Azure.

In this workshop, you will be able to see capabilities in SQL Server 2019 that can provide solutions for these challenges.

Instructor led workshops will review the overall capabilities and value of SQL Server 2019 using the **Module 2.0 Introduction Section** from the PowerPoint slides <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLGroundToCloud/slides/SQL%20Server%202019%20Modern%20Data%20Platform.pptx">SQL Server 2019 Modern Data Platform</a>

SQL Server 2017 introduced the world to SQL Server on Linux and Containers. SQL Server on Linux is completely compatible with SQL Server on Windows due to the unique design of the SQL Platform Abstraction Layer (SQLPAL). The core engine features of SQL Server on Linux work exactly as SQL Server on Windows because the engine codebase is the same on both platforms. However, there were some features that come with SQL Server that were not included in SQL Server 2017 on Linux. SQL Server 2019 shores up these gaps by including features like Replication.

Instructor led workshops will review SQL Server on Linux and Containers in SQL Server 2019 using the **Module 2.5 SQL Server on Linux and Containers** from the PowerPoint slides <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLGroundToCloud/slides/SQL%20Server%202019%20Modern%20Data%20Platform.pptx">SQL Server 2019 Modern Data Platform</a>

SQL Server 2019 meets other challenges faced by data professionals and developers with solutions like SQL Server Machine Learning Services, T-SQL Extensibility, and a series of supportability and engine performance enhancements.

Microsoft also provides a set of tools to assist with migration to SQL Server 2019 including the Database Migration Assistant (DMA), Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA), Query Tuning Assistant (QTA), and SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA).

Your instructor will discuss these topics and your next steps to be successful with SQL Server 2019 using the **Module 2.6 Additional Capabilities, Migrations, and Next steps section** from the PowerPoint slides <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLGroundToCloud/slides/SQL%20Server%202019%20Modern%20Data%20Platform.pptx">SQL Server 2019 Modern Data Platform</a>
